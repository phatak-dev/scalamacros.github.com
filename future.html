<p>
  Even though macros have already been released with Scala 2.10.0, development of the project didn't stop.
  We are actively implementing new features targetting future Scala releases.
  Check out <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html">the official Scaladoc site</a>
  to learn more about macro paradise, the cradle of progress in Scala macros.
</p>

<p>
  Starting from Aug 5th, we have made macro paradise available as a plugin to the 2.10.x series of Scala compilers.
  There is no more need to obtain custom builds of <code class="scala">scalac</code> to make use of our new functionality.
  With the paradise plugin, such features as quasiquotes are readily available in production Scala environments.
