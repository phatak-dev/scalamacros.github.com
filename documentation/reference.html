<p><a href="/talks/2012-04-28-MetaprogrammingInScala210.pdf">Metaprogramming in Scala 2.10</a>. Overview of the reflection API: briefly explains core data structures and gives a few recipes on discovering relevant information using hidden switches of compiler and REPL. The guide has been brought up to speed with 2.10.0-RC1</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/milestone/index.html#scala.reflect.api.package">Pre-release scaladoc for scala.reflect.api</a>. Outlines the data structures and factories that are used inside the compiler and their public API. Trees, symbols, types, annotations, positions, and more. <i>The link won't work until 2.10.0-RC1 is released.</i></p>

<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/milestone/index.html#scala.reflect.macros.package">Pre-release scaladoc for scala.reflect.macros</a>. Explains what can be done from within a macro, ranging from printing custom error messages to performing implicit searches.<i>The link won't work until 2.10.0-RC1 is released.</i></p>

<p><a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/reflection/overview.html">Reflection guide at docs.scala-lang.org</a>. Intended to be something like a collection guide for Scala reflection. This guide will subsume the overview linked above by the time 2.10.0 hits release.<i>The link won't work until 2.10.0-RC1 is released.</i></p>
