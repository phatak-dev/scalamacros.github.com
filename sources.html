<p>Vanilla macros ship with the Scala compiler starting from 2.10.0, so sources of their implementation can be found
in <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala">Scala's code repository</a>. Macros affect multiple subsystems of the compiler,
but the main chunk of logic resides in <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Macros.scala">scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Macros.scala</a>.</p>

<p>Macro paradise is a compiler plugin to Scala 2.10.x that adds new functionality such as quasiquotes and macro annotations.
It is hosted and published separately from mainline Scala at <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise">https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise</a>.</p>
