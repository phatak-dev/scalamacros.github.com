<p>Our code repository at GitHub is <a href="{{ site.github.url }}">{{ site.github.url }}</a>.
The <code>develop</code> branch hosts the most stable version of the macro-enabled Scala compiler,
other branches host experiments and bug fixes.</p>

<p>If you feel like experimenting, clone the repository and build it according to the instructions in the readme.
A good way to get some practical experience would be experimenting with macro tests that are located
in the <code>test/files</code> directory relative to the root of the checkout.</p>

<p>We also warmly welcome contributors. If you feel like working on project Kepler,
we will be very glad to hear from you at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.</p>
