<p>Macros ship with Scala starting from 2.10.0 M3.
Use download links at <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">Scala home page</a>,
or refer to an appropriate Scala version (2.10.0-M6 or 2.10.0-SNAPSHOT) in Maven or SBT.</p>

<p>Public compiler API (aka reflection API) has undergone major rehash in M4,
so examples and documentation from M3 will most likely not work for M4 and vice versa.
This site only covers the most recent developments and doesn't provide info about macros and reflection in M3.</p>

<p>If you feel like experimenting, you can clone our bleeding edge code repository at GitHub is <a href="{{ site.github.url }}">{{ site.github.url }}</a>.
The <code>develop</code> branch is the most stable, other branches host experimental features.
Building the repository should be as simple as running <code>ant</code>,
setting up an IDE is described <a href="/documentation/howtocontribute.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>We also warmly welcome contributors. If you feel like working on project Kepler,
we will be very glad to hear from you at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.</p>
