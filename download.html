<p>Macros ship with Scala starting from 2.10.0 M3.
Use download links at <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">Scala home page</a>,
or refer to an appropriate Scala version in Maven or SBT to get a macro-enabled Scala compiler.</p>

<p>If you feel like experimenting, you can clone our bleeding edge code repository at GitHub is <a href="{{ site.github.url }}">{{ site.github.url }}</a>.
The <code>develop</code> branch is the most stable, other branches host experimental features.
Building the repository should be simple if you follow the instructions in the readme,
setting up an IDE is more complex and is described <a href="/documentation/howtocontribute.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>We also warmly welcome contributors. If you feel like working on project Kepler,
we will be very glad to hear from you at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.</p>
