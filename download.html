<p>Our code repository at GitHub is <a href="{{ site.github.url }}">{{ site.github.url }}</a>.
However, there is nothing to download yet, since the project is still in early design phase.</p>

<p>If you got interested in project Kepler, you can take a look on our Scala improvement proposals at Google Docs 
(<a href="/sips/macros.html">Macros</a> and <a href="/sips/quasiquotations.html">Quasiquotations</a>) and stay tuned for updates.</p>

<p>We also warmly welcome contributors. If you feel like working on project Kepler, we will be very glad to hear from you at <a href="mailto:dev@scalamacros.org">dev@scalamacros.org</a>.</p>
