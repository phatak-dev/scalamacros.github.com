<p>Macros ship with the Scala compiler starting from 2.10.0.</p>

<p>To get started:
<ul><li>Create a separate project for your macros.</li>
<li>Reference <code>scala-reflect.jar</code> in the macro project.</li>
<li>Use <code>import language.experimental.macros</code> in the files where you define macros.</li>
<li>If in doubt, consult <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/overview.html">the docs</a>.</ul></p>

<p>Macros are also in active development within so-called <a href="/talks/2012-12-18-MacroParadise.pdf">macro paradise</a>,
a dedicated branch in the official Scala repository. By the beginning of January 2013 we will set up a nightly build
that will publish snapshot artifacts to Sonatype, and you will be able to use them in Maven and SBT. For now you can download
a build of macro paradise from <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10497693/pack.zip">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10497693/pack.zip</a>.</p>
