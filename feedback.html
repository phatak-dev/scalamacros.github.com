<p>From the start of the project we've received a lot of very useful feedback. Say, Chris and Stefan want to experiment with LINQ-flavored facilities for Scala. They need reification, composability of queries, static checking/optimization of queries and transparency for the user. After a couple of discussions, we've come up with several ways of doing all that stuff with macros in a win-win fashion.</p>

<p>We're hinting that at this very phase your feedback is priceless and has the possibility to significantly affect the design of Scala's macro system. Got a compelling use-case that can be simplified by macros? Just drop us a line! Macros are still experimental, so it would be very easy to adapt macros to your personal use-cases. Looking forward to your comments!</p>

<p>There are several options of submitting feedback:
<ul>
  <li>Comment on our Scala improvement proposal: <a href="/documentation.html">Self-cleaning macros</a>.
  <li>Submit your idea to the <a href="/usecases.html">Use cases</a> repository
  <li>Write an email directly to us: <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a></li>
  <li>Post your question or suggestion to the mailing list: <a href="{{site.google.group.url}}">{{site.google.group.url}}</a></li>
