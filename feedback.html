title: Feedback
---

<p>From the start of the project we've received a lot of very useful feedback. Say, Chris and Stefan want to experiment with LINQ-flavored facilities for Scala. They need reification, composability of queries, static checking/optimization of queries and transparency for the user. After a couple of discussions, we've come up with several ways of doing all that stuff with macros in a win-win fashion.</p>

<p>Also, for instance, Greg and Nada routinely have to bite the bullet and deal with gazillions of overloads that cover all those countless FunctionN and TupleN classes for their Scala to JavaScript crosscompiler. No problem, macros come to the rescue. After a brainstorming session, the draft of the proposal now features a way to generate tedious code with macros.</p>

<p>We're hinting that at this very phase your feedback is priceless and has the possibility to significantly affect the design of Scala's macro system. Got a compelling use-case that can be simplified by macros? Just drop us a line! We don't even have a beta version of macro-related Scala improvement proposal yet, so it would be very use to adapt macros to your personal use-cases. Looking forward to your comments!</p>

<p>There are several options of submitting feedback:
<ul>
