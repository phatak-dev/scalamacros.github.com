<p>The <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mainland/publications/mainland07quasiquoting.pdf">"Why It's Nice to be Quoted: Quasiquoting for Haskell"</a>
paper by Geoffrey B. Mainland describes an astonishing concept of embedding and integrating arbitrary languages into a sufficiently capable host language.</p>

<p>One of the most impressive examples in the paper involves a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization">peephole optimizer</a> for x86 assembly language.
The example exhibits such prominent features of quasiquoting as: 1) expressing ASTs in native syntax, 2) easy composition, 3) enjoyable pattern matching
(read more about quasiquotations in our walkthroughs: <a href="/talks/2011-09-27-ProjectKepler.pdf">English</a>, <a href="/talks/2011-10-29-RuProjectKepler.pdf">Russian</a>).</p>

{% highlight haskell %}
peep :: [Asm] -> [Asm]
peep [:asm | mov&s $&r1, &r2
             cmp $&r3, &r4
             je &lbl |] : rest
     | r3 == r1 && r4 == r2

   = [:asm | mov&s $&r1, &r2
             jmp &lbl |] : rest
...
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The point here is that a language with quasiquotations (which constitute <a href="/sips/quasiquotations.html">a part of our proposal</a>) can subsume and embed
arbitrary external domain-specific languages, granted someone implement quasiquoting services (parsing, splicing, pattern matching) for that language.</p>

<p>Taken to the extreme by the developers of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nemerle-2/">Nemerle 2.0</a>, this idea might lead to the very host language and its type system
being implemented in such a fashion. In Nemerle 2.0, RSDN guys plan to implement high-level DSLs for syntax and typing rules, so that the compiler, effectively,
becomes a metacircular metacompiler. Though, I digress.</p>

<p>Beauty of this concept from the pragmatic standpoint comes from the fact that these external DSLs
can be processed (for example, validated) by macros, which are evaluated during the compile time.
This means that format strings, regexes, XML (less relevant for Scala), HTML, JavaScript - all those can be to certain extent validated during the compilation of the application,
bringing additional static safety to the program.</p>

<p>Another useful application of this notion is convenient notation for new kinds of literals.
For example, with the syntax introduced by <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NdxNxZYodPA-c4MLr33KzwzKFkzm9iW9POexT9PkJsU/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1">SIP: String interpolation and formatting</a>
one could write <code>b"10001"</code> to express an integer literal <code>17</code>.
The interpolation would be processed by a macro during the compile-time, which means that the programmer wouldn't pay any runtime penalty for the convenience.</p>
