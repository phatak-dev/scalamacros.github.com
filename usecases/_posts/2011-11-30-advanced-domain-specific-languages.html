<p>One of the most important use cases of compile-time metaprogramming involves increasing the area of applicability of embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs).</p>

<p>As it was nicely summarized in <a href="http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/2011/5007/EPFL_TH5007.pdf">Embedded Domain-Specific Languages using Libraries 
and Dynamic Metaprogramming</a> by Gilles Dubochet, sooner or later DSLs hit the limitations of even very advanced programming languages.
Here's an illustrative example from <a href="http://squeryl.org/">Squeryl</a>, a Scala ORM for SQL databases:</p>

{% highlight scala %}
var avg: Option[Float] =
  from(grades)(g =>
    where(g.subjectId === mathId)   
    compute(avg(g.scoreInPercentage))
  )
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This query look almost like a series of high-order functions applied to a collection, and, in fact, it is: 
everything is strongly-typed and usual stuff (e.g. closing over the <code>mathId</code> variable) works as expected.</p>

<p>However, this comes at a price. First of all, <a href="https://github.com/max-l/Squeryl/tree/master/src/main/scala/org/squeryl/dsl">the amount of syntactic boilerplate</a> is truly gigantic.
Moreover, even Scala's type system is still not enough to serve the DSL. In order to capture the <code>subjectId</code> field access, 
Squeryl builds an auxiliary instance of type <code>Grade</code>, wraps it into a proxy and sifts that proxy through the query during the runtime, 
recording accesses to fields and building the corresponding AST.</p>

<p>And still, all this effort is not enough to provide seamless embedding into the host language. See that <code>===</code>? 
This is a special surrogate operator that stands for <code>==</code>, because the equality operator itself cannot be overloaded to produce desired results.</p>

<p>If <code>from</code> were a <code>macro def</code>, then it would get the <code>g => ...</code> function argument
in the form of a <code>Tree</code> object that represents that query at the compile-time. 
As a consequence, one would then be able to use any syntax in the query (including non-overloadable constructs, such as the equality operator).
Also, the lifting (i.e. transformation of domain-specific codes into corresponding domain ASTs) would come for free, 
without the need to carefully arrange the web of boilerplate to capture the intent of the user.</p>

<p>This brings sweet memories of coding up <a href="https://github.com/xeno-by/conflux">Conflux</a>, the framework for programming CUDA in pure C#.
Since the computational architecture of massively parallel devices is incompatible with von Neumann architecture, I didn't even have a luxury of symbolic evaluation
that is employed in Squeryl. Instead I went for writing <a href="https://github.com/xeno-by/truesight">a decompiler for .NET bytecode</a>.
If I were programming in a language with macros, that effort would be completely unnecessary. For example, take a look how a similar goal is achieved by the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nuda/">NUDA</a> library written in <a href="http://nemerle.org">Nemerle</a>.</p>
