<p>Recently <a href="/news/2013/04/22/let-our-powers-combine.html">we have published a paper</a> covering the state of the art of macrology in Scala 2.10. It provides an interesting perspective and an up-to-date interpretation of some of the originally envisioned use cases for Scala macros.</p>

Our talk <a href="/paperstalks/2013-07-17-WhatAreMacrosGoodFor.pdf">"What Are Macros Good For?"</a> describes and systemizes uses that macros found among Scala 2.10 users. The thesis of the talk is that macros are good for code generation, static checking and DSLs, illustrated with a number of examples from research and industry.</p>
