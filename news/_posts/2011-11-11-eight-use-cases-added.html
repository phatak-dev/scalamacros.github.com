<p>To be honest, this site, created a few days ago, wasn't intended for going all public right off the bat. 
Instead, I planned to gradually improve the content and then release it without hassle.</p>

<p>As you can guess, it was a complete surprise for me to hear from Tiark that 
the site <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3215210">has been mentioned on Hacker News</a>.
My first thought was: "Omg, I didn't have the time to write about use cases for macros".
And rightly so - the very first comment pointed that "thing that bothers me is the empty 'Use cases' page. 
Scala macros might be a solution to a problem nobody has". Oh, dear, what a shame!</p>

<p>That's why I tried hard to put up several <a href="/usecases/index.html">use cases</a> 
that I've gathered during the last few months of conversations about macros.
I hope that this will alleviate possible misunderstandings that have arisen.</p>

<p>In any case, thanks for your feedback, folks - it's very inspiring to know 
that project Kepler has found its audience right after the inception!</p>
