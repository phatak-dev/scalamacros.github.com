<p>Hi everyone! When you'll be reading this message, our last milestone build of the 2.0.0 paradise series will already be available at Sonatype. Scala 2.11.0 is already on the verge of being released, and we're also tying the final loose ends, preparing to cut 2.0.0-final.</p>

<p>In this release, we have fixed a couple of issues with REPL (<a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/18">#18</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/19">#19</a>) and did an almost complete backport of 2.11.0-RC3 quasiquotes to paradise 2.10.x (<a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/15">#15</a>). Yes, that's right - 2.0.0-M4 brings a long-awaited update of the quasiquote engine, backporting almost half a year worth of Denys's hacking to Scala 2.10.x. Almost all cool new things introduced recently in scala/scala are going to work (including the updated Liftable mechanism), apart from the following few cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Standard liftables aren't part of <code>scala.reflect.api.Universe</code>, but have to be imported or mixed in (import <code>scala.quasiquotes.RuntimeLiftables._</code> or subclass <code>scala.quasiquotes.StandardLiftables</code>).</li>
  <li>Pattern matching doesn't support while loops and functions with underscores.</li>
  <li>Pattern matching doesn't support complex multi-dot unliftables.</li>
  <li>Pattern matcher isn't particularly good at matching complex typechecked trees.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second and the fourth limitations should be not very hard to fix, but the third one looks really tricky. We'll do our best to address these issues before 2.0.0-final, and in the meanwhile you can subscribe to <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/20">paradise/issues/20</a> to get updates as they happen.</p>
