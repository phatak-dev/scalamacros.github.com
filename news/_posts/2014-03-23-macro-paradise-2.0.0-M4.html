<!-- <p>23 Mar 2014. As reported by Nick Stanchenko, the 2.0.0-M4 release had a blocker issue with liftables, which was fixed in 2.0.0-M5 that has been published shortly after M4. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough as Nick Stanchenko and Tomer Gabel have uncovered another blocker in M5. Therefore, for the moment, we advise against using M4 and M5. Please use the the battle-proven 2.0.0-M3.</p>

We believe to have identified and fixed the source of the error and are going to release M6 one of these days after we are sure that everything works fine. Ideally, we might be able to deliver 2.0.0-final along with the release of Scala 2.11.0-final, but that remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! When you'll be reading this message, our last milestone build of the 2.0.0 paradise series will already be available at Sonatype. Scala 2.11.0 is already on the verge of being released, and we're also tying the final loose ends, preparing to cut 2.0.0-final.</p>

<p>In this release, we have fixed a couple of issues with REPL (<a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/18">#18</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/19">#19</a>) and did an almost complete backport of 2.11.0-RC3 quasiquotes to paradise 2.10.x (<a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/15">#15</a>). Yes, that's right - 2.0.0-M4 and 2.0.0-M5 bring a long-awaited update of the quasiquote engine, backporting almost half a year worth of Denys's hacking to Scala 2.10.x. Almost all cool new things introduced recently in scala/scala are going to work (including the updated Liftable mechanism), apart from the following few cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Standard liftables aren't part of <code>scala.reflect.api.Universe</code>, but have to be imported or mixed in (import <code>scala.quasiquotes.RuntimeLiftables._</code> or subclass <code>scala.quasiquotes.StandardLiftables</code>).</li>
  <li>Pattern matching doesn't support while loops and functions with underscores.</li>
  <li>Pattern matching doesn't support complex multi-dot unliftables.</li>
  <li>Pattern matcher isn't particularly good at matching complex typechecked trees.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second and the fourth limitations should be not very hard to fix, but the third one looks really tricky. We'll do our best to address these issues before 2.0.0-final, and in the meanwhile you can subscribe to <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/20">paradise/issues/20</a> to get updates as they happen.</p>
