<p>The journey to macroland keeps amazing me!</p>

<p>Take splices. At first they seemed just a clever response to AST composability issue. Then I figured out that <a href="/talks/2011-09-27-ProjectKepler.pdf">splices can be used to drastically simplify pattern matching</a>. But even that didn't exhaust the bag of tricks provided by splices!</p>

<p>A few days after the pattern matching revelation, I learned how <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10497693/Library/Computer%20Science/Metaprogramming/Macros/Quasiquotations/Syntax/Ellipses%20in%20Scheme.pdf?dl">schemers use ellipses to write declarative syntax transformers</a>. Say, we want to code up the following syntactic transformation: (let ([var val] ...) body) = ((lambda (var ...) body) val ...). Clear and concise, but imagine how ugly this will become when we'll try to transform this informal notation into executable code.</p>

<p>This problem has been addressed by Eugene Kohlbecker, a researcher from Scheme community. He extended the macro system to literally understand those ellipses:</p>

{% highlight scheme %}
(define-syntax my-let
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((my-let ((var val) ...) body)
      ((lambda (var ...) body) val ...))))
{% endhighlight %}
