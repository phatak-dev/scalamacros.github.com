<p>Announced right before 2.10.0-final, <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html">macro paradise</a> became the home for experimentation in the macro land. In this talk I will cover the ideas we played with and outline what panned out and what did not. What's going to happen to quasiquotes? Are type macros useful enough? Do macro annotations make sense? Come over and find out the answers.</p>
