<p>Simultaneously with the release of Scala 2.10.0-final, tentatively scheduled for 26 December 2012, we're going to announce the availability of paradise/macros, a dedicated branch in our official Scala repository which will host the latest macro developments.</p>

<p>When things like macro types, macro annotations or type inference-friendly macros - you name it - get ripe for beta testing, they are going to end up in paradise/macros. Much like the vanilla Scala, macro paradise is going to be built nightly and have its own Maven artifact, so it'll be very easy to use it in your projects.</p>

<p>In this talk I present a couple of new features that will be released into paradise this Christmas, along with a glimpse of the things to come. I also discuss the roadmap of macro development for the near future, so if you want to have something in Scala macros, be sure to take a look and speak up.</p>
