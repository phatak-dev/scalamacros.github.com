<p>My previous plans involved slowly starting with quasiquotations and gradually proceeding further, however, an unexpected event turned everything upside down.</p> 

<p>Apparently, <a href="http://scalaquery.org">Stefan Zeiger</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/scala-integrated-query/">Christopher Vogt</a> 
will be working at LAMP/TypeSafe starting from this October, and they are going to participate in a joint fun project of implementing LINQ for Scala. 
What a stunning use-case for macros! Would be really awesome to roll something working asap.</p>
