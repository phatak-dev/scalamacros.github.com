<p>I have just updated <a href="/documentation/index.html">documentation</a> for macros.
It now features a getting started example and a reference of macro context and reflection API.</p>

<p>The documentation also features my recent talk about <a href="/talks/2012-04-28-MetaprogrammingInScala210.pdf">metaprogramming in Scala 2.10</a>.
Be sure to take a look, because the slides not only describe trees, symbols and types - three core data structures of Scala compiler, but also
suggest a few tricks that make it easy to explore compiler's inner workings and find out necessary information by yourself.</p>
