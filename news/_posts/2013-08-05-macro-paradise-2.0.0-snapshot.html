<p>It is my pleasure to announce a new major version of macro paradise, featuring new exciting functionality
and repackaged for the ultimate ease of use.</p>

<code><pre>00:58 ~/210x $ scalac -Xplugin:macro-paradise_2.10.2-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Xshow-phases
             phase name  id  description

<p><b>Now a compiler plugin for 2.10.x</b></p>

<p><a href="/news/2012/12/18/macro-paradise.html">Previous versions</a> of macro paradise were distributed as custom builds
of a fork of Scala compiler. They were reasonably easy to experiment with, but tricky for everything else - being a custom build
of <code>scalac</code> creates problems with SBT and Eclipse, complicates usage of third-party libraries, and ultimately
locks us into an eternal snapshot preventing from reasonable versioning.</p>

<p>However since today, paradise is a compiler plugin targetting official Scala compilers of the 2.10.x series,
making latest macro developments available to anyone using the latest stable version of Scala.
For example, there's no longer need to wait for Scala 2.11 to make use of quasiquotes -
with the paradise plugin, quasiquotes already work in the production Scala environment.</p>

<p><b>Featuring quasiquotes and macro annotations</b></p>

<p>The first preview of macro paradise 2.0 includes: 1) quasiquotes that immensely simplify construction and deconstruction of ASTs,
and 2) macro annotations that provide a robust and powerful facility for doing global code generation.
You can check out the macro corner at <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html">docs.scala-lang.org</a> for details
(<a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/quasiquotes.html">quasiquotes</a>, <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/annotations.html">macro annotations</a>), and here I will provide a short summary.</p>

<p>Quasiquotes are a backport of what's been recently released as a part of Scala 2.11.0-M4 and scheduled for inclusion
in Scala 2.11. They allow one to write <code>q"..."</code>, <code>tq"..."</code>, <code>cq"..."</code>, and <code>pq"..."</code>
with Scala code and possibly interpolation splices in quotes, to construct and deconstruct trees in a WYSIWYG fashion.
In paradise, just like in the recent milestone release of 2.11, to enable quasiquotes you only need to import
the members of the corresponding universe, e.g. <code>import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._</code> or <code>import c.universe._</code>
(trick question: how did we pull this off given that paradise is just a compiler plugin that can't change the standard library?).</p>

<p>Macro annotations bring textual abstraction to the level of definitions. Annotating any top-level or nested definition with something
that Scala recognizes as a macro will let it expand, possibly into multiple members. Unlike in the previous versions of macro paradise,
macro annotations in 2.0 are done right in the sense that they: 1) apply not just to classes and objects, but to arbitrary definitions,
2) allow to introduce static members (i.e. expansions of classes can affect companions).
This opens a number of new possibilities in code generation land, including customizable case classes and better enums.

<p>In the spirit of Scala macros, macro annotations are as untyped as possible to stay flexible and
as typed as possible to remain useful. On the one hand, macro annottees are untyped, so that we can change their signatures (e.g. lists
of class members). But on the other hand, the thing about all flavors of Scala macros is integration with the typechecker, and
macro annotations are not an exceptions. During expansion we can have all the type information that's possible to have
(e.g. we can reflect against the surrounding program or perform type checks / implicit lookups in the enclosing context).</p>

<p><b>Type macros are out</b></p>

<p>If you have been using paradise before, you might've noticed that the list of supported features doesn't include
<a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/typemacros.html">type macros</a>. You might've also heard rumors that type macros
are unlikely to be included in future versions of Scala. This is not a coincidence - let me elaborate.</p>

<p>Type macros are an embodiment of textual abstraction - they recognize pieces of text that match a specification
and replace them according to a procedure. Even though this concept is less useful for types than for terms, it has still found its niches:
1) encoding computations at type level by naturally extending what type aliases already do, 2) generating publicly visible code by
expanding references to parents in definitions of classes and objects.</p>

<p>However, as practice shows, type macros are not the best fit for both of these tasks. 1) Textual abstraction alone isn't enough
for type-level computations, because most often immediate expansion is not what's really needed. Think of it that way:
when writing <code>List[T]</code> in a function definition, you don't want it to be replaced with some newly generated type,
but rather want it to be retained in the signature to be used later during type checking and inference. 2) Treating references to parents
as something expandable is interesting, but this notion doesn't scale to codegen over members.</p>

<p>Therefore there have been concerns that type macros don't pull their weight as a dedicated language feature
in a potential future release of Scala, and we've been very worried about that, because marrying research with production for the greater good
has been the ultimate goal of Scala macros from day one.</p>

<p>After careful consideration, we have found replacements for most of the use cases of type macros in order to both meet
the requirements of the language design committee and to provide an upgrade path for our valued early adopters who have already invested
in macro-based solutions. <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/implicits.html">Implicit macros</a> provide a macro-based
approach for a great share of type computation use cases,
and <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/implicits.html">macro annotations</a> fill the code generation role.
Both are immediately available in macro paradise 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.</p>

<p><b>What's coming next?</b></p>

<p>In the next few weeks we plan to introduce
<a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/implicits.html#fundep_materialization">fundep materialization</a>
along with some fixes to implicit search that will reveal the full potential of implicit macros. We also have several
other features in the works, but it's too early to share details now - stay tuned for updates.</p>

<p>And as always, development of Scala macros is very much shaped by early adopters. We value your opinion,
are glad to help with your macro questions, and are always up for a good discussion over a macro or two:
<ul><li>Are there solid use cases for
<a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/untypedmacros.html">untyped macros</a>, or we shouldn't even port them to the new paradise now that we have macro annotations?</li>
<li>What else would you like to see in paradise and ultimately in Scala?</li>
<li>Existing features don't work for you?</li></ul></p>
