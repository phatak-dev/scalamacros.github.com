<p>Over the last few days there have been several questions about the roadmap for macro paradise and
the future of its current features, and this post will elaborate on that.</p>

<p>The foundation of the Scala macros project is having production Scala as the ultimate target.
Within this project, macro paradise is intended to be an incubator of features that we are proposing or
will at some point of time propose for inclusion in mainline Scala. Macro bundles and quasiquotes
have successfully graduated from paradise and are already in Scala 2.11.0-M4, soon to be ported
fundep materializers are planned to follow as well.</p>

<p>On the road from paradise to trunk, some features change their shape according to the feedback we receive
from the community and the Scala improvement process committee. However, when changing features, we always try to
retain their core ideas and provide a migration path to our users. (And so far, we've been pretty successful at that.)</p>

<p>Therefore it's useful to think about paradise features as notions. For example, the notion of quasiquoting
has been with us since December 2011. It's been rejected once, but then it made a glorious reappearance in another form
and is now part of trunk. Another example would be the notion of generating publicly visible definitions.
It was tough luck for type macros, but we've reimplemented them as macro annotations, and now macro annotations will carry the banner
of global codegen to the official Scala.</p>

<p>On a more concrete note, once Scala 2.11 is released, we will update macro paradise to support it.
All the features in the current paradise (quasiquotes, macro annotations), along with soon-to-arrive fundep materializers,
will be supported in paradise for 2.11. We are currently working with the Typesafe compiler team to define an explicit interface
to the compiler that will guarantee that our plugin (that currently uses undocumented ways to hijack the compilation pipeline)
remains operational after the changes introduced in 2.11.</p>

<p>Long story short, the goal of macro paradise is to make official Scala better. Your feedback helps that immensely,
and we're working hard on making paradise as easy to use as possible. We also guarantee that current features are not going
to disappear in the next release, so you can use them today without the fear that they're going to stop working tomorrow
or the day after tomorrow.</p>
