<p>As we speak, the 2.0.0-M2 version of macro paradise has already been made available at Sonatype and is being prepared to be synced to
Maven Central. This release brings fixes to issues <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/9">#9</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/10">#10</a>, and also takes a tiny stab at <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/14">#14</a>.

<p>While we're working our way towards the final release scheduled to accompany Scala 2.11.0-final, we plan to address the two blockers that we have so far: <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/11">#11</a> (problems with quasiquote helper injection) and <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/15">#15</a> (increasing disparity between quasiquotes in 2.10 paradise and 2.11 trunk). We might also manage to fix <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues/14">#14</a> (c.typeCheck doesn't see declarations from the current scope), but that's a tough one, so it's hard to predict whether we'll make it in time.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact us with questions, bug reports and new feature proposals either <a href="https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/issues">at GitHub</a> or <a href="mailto:eugene.burmako@epfl.ch">via email</a>. We are looking forward to making sure that paradise works the way you'd like it for your use cases!</p>
